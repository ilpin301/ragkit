**Delete the LLM response cache.** Only after `EXITCODE=0` AND every verification step has passed:

```powershell
docker stop $Container     # never delete while the server holds its own in-memory copy
Remove-Item (Join-Path $Store 'kv_store_llm_response_cache.json')
```

LightRAG recreates the file empty on the next run. This is deliberate, not housekeeping: the cache
exists so a crashed or interrupted run can be replayed without paying for extraction twice, and once
a run has succeeded and verified there is nothing left to replay. It reached ~69 MB / 35k extraction
entries on one base before the first cleanup.

Accepted cost: re-ingesting that document later pays full LLM extraction again, and the first queries
after cleanup run cold while the query-mode cache refills.

**Never delete it on failure, and never before verification.** A killed run's cache is the only thing
that makes the relaunch cheap — that is the whole point of [[project_ingest_cache_flush]]. Deleting
early converts a 15-minute relaunch into a full re-extraction.
